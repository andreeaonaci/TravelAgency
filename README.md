This project was presented in the OOP course, at the laboratory section.

This creates a Java Desktop Application with the tematic of Travelling. It has 2 roles, the admin and the user. It uses a DB in order to facilitate the data resources. 

The admin can add a project to the DB with some fields which must be filled and to see the feedbacks of the customers which already was in a trip organized by that admin. An admin can see only the feedback for the projects assigned to him.

The user can reserve a ticket for a trip choosing by some filtering conditions and can see the price which are implied by the chosen options. He can also give a feedback for the project, but only after the period of the project is ended.
